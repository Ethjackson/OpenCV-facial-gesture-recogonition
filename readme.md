# A small personal project utilizing openCV and MediaPipe for the first time.
https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dd/d43/tutorial_py_video_display.html and https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions and https://github.com/nicknochnack/AdvancedHandPoseWithMediaPipe/blob/main/Advanced%20HandPose%20Tracking.ipynb aided in learning.

## A single encapsulated function using MediaPipe's hand landmarks to detect if a user is using profanity (middle finger) and will block it out with a black box. 
More would could definitly be added one day to make it an actual profanity filter, with models to detect profanity from image datasets to take it beyond just middle finger recognition
